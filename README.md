# Blockchain With Python

This python script consist of a basic implementation of the blockchain using Python. Streamlit was used in order to create a simple web application for ease of use. The following screenshots show some example usage of the web page:

# Implementation:
To simulate a simple blockchain, the following classes were implemented:

* Record: a class used to record transactions.
* Block: the block of the blockchain, will hold the verified records (transactions).
* Pychain: the chain of the blockchain, will link new verified hashed blocks to the new hashed block.
* Streamlit: the library used to create a simple web application to visual the simple blockchain.
